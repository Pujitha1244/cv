    <h3><em><strong>Project Details</strong></em></h3>
    <p><strong>Project Title:</strong>Eye Ball Cursor Movement Using OpenCV</p>
    <p><strong>My Role:</strong>Team Leader</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong>There are different reasons for which people need an artificial of locomotion such as a
      virtual keyboard.The number of people, who need to move around with the help of some article means, because of an illness.
      Moreover, implementing a controlling system in it enables them to move without the help of another person is very helpful.
      he idea of eye controls of great use to not only the future of natural input but more importantly the handicapped and
      disabled. Camera is capturing the image of eye movement. First detect pupil center position of eye. Then the different
      variation on pupil position get different command set for virtual keyboard.The signals pass the motor driver to interface
      with the virtual keyboard itself.The motor driver will control both speed and direction to enable the virtual keyboard to
      move forward, left, right and stop.</p>
